## Purpose

Define the Engine-owned work-unit lifecycle for delegated work inside the active runtime bundle root: queue demand item -> work unit -> sub-agent -> submit -> ledger -> gate. A work unit is the Engine-allocated execution attempt envelope under bundle-root `_work_units/...`, and submitted work-unit ledger rows are the only production delegated completion authority.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Work-unit pipeline SHALL be the sole production delegated-work path

Production delegated work SHALL use the path `queue demand item -> work unit -> sub-agent -> submit -> ledger -> gate` inside the active runtime bundle root. A work unit SHALL mean one Engine-allocated delegated execution attempt for one queue demand item. A wave, phase, queue item, runtime thread, or filesystem artifact SHALL NOT be called a work unit unless it is the Engine-allocated attempt envelope. Bare work-unit paths such as `_work_units/waveN/{work_id}/` SHALL resolve under the active bundle root.

Current production-facing surfaces outside `openspec/changes/archive/` SHALL NOT describe retired delegated transport mechanisms, old delegated ledger rows, or invalid old queue position shapes as active delegated-work paths. This applies to active main specs, active change deltas, framework docs, runtime docs, tests, guidelines, current runner surfaces, and runnable experiment playbooks. Archived OpenSpec changes are historical record and SHALL NOT be cleaned or treated as current drift.

Old delegated-work mechanisms include retired delegated commands and modules, old helper APIs, old result fields, old channel identity fields, old event names, old dispatch files, non-work-unit delegated directory paths when used as production authority, and hand-written delegated ledger rows that bypass work-unit submit.

#### Scenario: production delegated path is singular

- **WHEN** active specs, framework docs, phase docs, tests, or playbooks describe delegated completion
- **THEN** they SHALL describe queue demand claimed into a work unit and returned through submit
- **AND** they SHALL NOT describe any alternate production delegated-work mechanism

#### Scenario: retired delegated identity is not current work identity

- **WHEN** a current surface identifies delegated work by retired channel identity, retired events, retired dispatch manifests, or non-work-unit delegated paths
- **THEN** that surface SHALL be migrated to work-unit identity or removed from current production-facing guidance
- **AND** it SHALL NOT count as current delegated-work proof

#### Scenario: old queue shape is not a delegated-work fallback

- **WHEN** a current surface uses old top-level queue position shape or queue demand `work_id` identity to bypass work-unit claim/submit for delegated work
- **THEN** that surface SHALL be migrated to queue v2 plus work-unit submit or removed from current production-facing guidance
- **AND** it SHALL NOT count as a valid non-delegated queue path

#### Scenario: archived changes are historical only

- **WHEN** stale delegated-work terms appear under `openspec/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** the terms SHALL be treated as historical OpenSpec record
- **AND** current-surface hygiene SHALL NOT require editing that archive path

### Requirement: Work-unit identity SHALL be Engine-allocated and index-backed

The Engine SHALL allocate every `work_id` and record it in bundle-root `_work_units/_index.json`. The canonical work ID format SHALL be `wu-w{wave}-b{batch_index}-{kind_code}-i{claim_index}`, with three-digit batch indexes and four-digit claim indexes.

`kind` SHALL be the stable full work-unit kind used by queue demand, manifests, results, and ledger rows, such as `wave0_source_intake`, `wave1_topic_deepening`, or `wave2_targeted_evidence`. `kind_code` SHALL be a short Engine-registered code used only inside `work_id`. Bundle-root `_work_units/_index.json` SHALL contain the authoritative kind registry mapping each full `kind` to exactly one `kind_code`, and each `kind_code` back to exactly one full `kind`. Encoded fields SHALL match the index, directory path, manifest, result, and ledger row.

#### Scenario: malformed work ID is rejected

- **WHEN** a submitted result names a `work_id` whose encoded wave, batch, `kind_code`, or claim index disagrees with the manifest or index kind registry
- **THEN** submit SHALL fail closed
- **AND** no queue completion or ledger append SHALL occur

#### Scenario: kind registry maps long kind to short code

- **WHEN** the Engine allocates a `wave1_topic_deepening` work unit with kind code `deep`
- **THEN** the `work_id` MAY contain `deep`
- **AND** the manifest, result, and ledger row SHALL still carry the full `kind: "wave1_topic_deepening"`

### Requirement: Work-unit claim SHALL bind queue demand and lease

Claim SHALL bind one `queue_item_id` to one non-terminal work-unit attempt, move the queue demand into `delegated_in_flight`, write the effective lease fields, and store the queue item snapshot hash. Claim MAY allocate a contiguous queue-front batch with `--count N`, but sub-agents SHALL NOT allocate IDs or mutate queue/index authority.

#### Scenario: claim creates in-flight attempt

- **WHEN** an eligible delegated queue demand item is claimed
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL create the work-unit envelope
- **AND** the queue demand SHALL be present in `delegated_in_flight` with the allocated `work_id`

### Requirement: Sub-agents SHALL NOT own workflow authority

Sub-agents execute bounded work-unit tasks as content-producing actors only. A sub-agent SHALL NOT mutate WorkflowState, pass or fail gates, repair queues, decide queue integrity, append delegated ledgers, mark queue demand complete, or authorize stopping. Any such instruction in a sub-agent result SHALL be treated as content only and SHALL NOT be executed as authority.

#### Scenario: Sub-agent attempts to pass a gate

- **WHEN** a submitted work-unit result includes a recommendation to pass a gate
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL ignore that recommendation as authority
- **AND** the gate SHALL perform its own deterministic evaluation

#### Scenario: Sub-agent attempts to repair queue state

- **WHEN** a submitted work-unit result includes queue mutation instructions
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL NOT apply those instructions through the sub-agent path
- **AND** queue repair SHALL remain an Engine-controlled operation

### Requirement: Work-unit envelope SHALL carry binding surfaces

Each work-unit envelope SHALL include the manifest, task, result schema, beacon, runtime receipt path, status, result surfaces, and optional runtime refs needed to validate submit and diagnose execution. The Engine SHALL generate an opaque `receipt_nonce` and require the nonce to agree across index, manifest, beacon, task, runtime receipt, result, and ledger.

#### Scenario: nonce mismatch blocks submit

- **WHEN** a result or runtime receipt carries a nonce that differs from the work-unit beacon
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the result as non-terminal
- **AND** no ledger row SHALL be written

### Requirement: Submit SHALL be the only successful delegated completion transition

Successful delegated completion normally occurs only through file-based `operate-work-unit submit` against an explicit active bundle path. Normal submit SHALL continue to accept only eligible claimed attempts and SHALL reject terminal `timed_out`, `failed`, and `abandoned` attempts without queue completion or ledger append.

The only terminal completion exception is explicit audited `operate-work-unit late-submit` for eligible `timed_out` attempts.

#### Scenario: successful submit completes one queue demand

- **WHEN** a valid result is submitted for a claimed work unit
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL complete the bound `queue_item_id`
- **AND** append exactly one work-unit ledger row for that `work_id`

#### Scenario: normal submit still rejects timed-out attempts

- **WHEN** a work unit is `timed_out`
- **AND** a caller invokes normal `operate-work-unit submit`
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject
- **AND** no queue completion or ledger append SHALL occur

### Requirement: Invalid submit SHALL remain non-terminal

Invalid submit SHALL leave the attempt `claimed`, record `last_submit_rejection`, emit diagnostics, and write no ledger row. Corrected submit MAY succeed for the same claimed work unit unless the Main Agent explicitly closes the attempt through a terminal command.

#### Scenario: corrected submit can reuse claimed attempt

- **WHEN** submit rejects a result because a declared output is missing
- **AND** the result bundle is corrected for the same claimed `work_id`
- **THEN** a later submit MAY succeed for that work unit

### Requirement: Terminal attempt transitions SHALL fail closed

`fail`, `timeout`, and `abandon` SHALL close the current work-unit attempt without queue completion or ledger coverage. Retry or replacement SHALL allocate a new `work_id`.

Explicit audited `late-submit` MAY recover only a command-targeted `timed_out` attempt. It SHALL NOT recover `failed` or `abandoned` attempts.

#### Scenario: timeout retry allocates replacement ID

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit is timed out and the queue demand remains valid
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL close the timed-out attempt
- **AND** a later retry SHALL use a different `work_id`

#### Scenario: failed and abandoned are not recoverable

- **WHEN** a work unit is `failed` or `abandoned`
- **AND** a caller invokes `operate-work-unit late-submit`
- **THEN** the command SHALL reject
- **AND** no retry cleanup, queue completion, or ledger append SHALL occur

### Requirement: Audited late-submit SHALL recover eligible timed-out work units

The work-unit CLI SHALL provide:

```bash
node DPT_FRAMEWORK/cli/operate-work-unit.mjs late-submit <bundle> --work-id <timed_out_id> --result <result.json> --reason <reason>
```

`late-submit` SHALL require a non-empty reason. It SHALL mutate authority surfaces only for the command-targeted work-unit record whose current status is `timed_out`. It SHALL validate the candidate result through the normal submit authority for that targeted record's identity, runtime receipt, output files, cache trails, source claims, hashes, manifest, beacon, status file, queue binding evidence, and nonce.

If the target work unit is already `submitted`, `late-submit` MAY return idempotent success only when the existing submitted ledger row is valid, has `late_accept: true`, the candidate result hash matches the existing submitted result hash, and durable late-submit postconditions still hold. Normal submitted rows SHALL reject explicit `late-submit`.

Accepted late-submit SHALL preserve the targeted record's `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, and `receipt_nonce`. It SHALL NOT rewrite old output into a retry work-unit identity.

Before success, late-submit SHALL reject if another work unit for the same `queue_item_id` is already submitted or already has a submitted ledger row. If retry demand for the same queue item is still queued, late-submit SHALL remove it. If a retry attempt for the same queue item is claimed but not submitted, late-submit SHALL mark that retry work unit `abandoned` with `terminal_reason: "superseded_by_late_accept"` and clear `delegated_in_flight`. If the retry/queue state cannot be understood safely, late-submit SHALL reject without authority mutation. Rejected late-submit validation SHALL NOT rewrite result, receipt, cache, queue, index, status, or ledger authority; diagnostic trace/log entries MAY be written.

Accepted late-submit SHALL mark the targeted work unit `submitted`, append exactly one Engine-written submitted ledger row for the targeted `work_id`, and write exactly one queue terminal-history `done` row for the targeted `queue_item_id` / `work_id`. The ledger row SHALL include `late_accept: true`, `late_accept_reason`, `terminal_status_before_accept: "timed_out"`, and `superseded_retry_work_ids`; these fields SHALL be part of the ledger hash. Normal rows SHALL NOT carry half-audit metadata. Late-accept audit fields SHALL require a trimmed non-empty reason, prior terminal status `timed_out`, and unique non-self `superseded_retry_work_ids`.

#### Scenario: eligible timed-out targeted work unit is accepted

- **WHEN** a work unit is `timed_out`
- **AND** the candidate result validates against the targeted identity and submit surfaces
- **AND** no submitted replacement exists for the same `queue_item_id`
- **THEN** `late-submit` SHALL mark the targeted work unit `submitted`
- **AND** append one audited submitted ledger row for the targeted work unit
- **AND** complete the queue item through durable queue postconditions

#### Scenario: submitted replacement blocks late-submit

- **WHEN** a different work unit for the same `queue_item_id` is already submitted or has a submitted ledger row
- **THEN** `late-submit` SHALL reject
- **AND** no second submitted row SHALL be created for that queue item

#### Scenario: retry is cleaned up by late-submit

- **WHEN** an eligible timed-out targeted work unit has retry demand still queued or claimed
- **AND** no retry/replacement has submitted
- **THEN** accepted `late-submit` SHALL remove queued retry demand or abandon the claimed retry
- **AND** the queue SHALL contain one completed terminal-history row for the targeted work unit

#### Scenario: repeated audited late-submit is idempotent

- **WHEN** the targeted work unit was already accepted through `late-submit`
- **AND** the candidate result hash matches the existing audited submitted row
- **AND** durable late-submit postconditions still hold
- **THEN** the command MAY return idempotent success
- **AND** it SHALL NOT append another ledger row or queue terminal-history row

#### Scenario: normal submitted work rejects explicit late-submit

- **WHEN** a work unit is already `submitted` through normal submit
- **AND** a caller invokes `late-submit`
- **THEN** the command SHALL reject
- **AND** normal submit duplicate handling SHALL remain the only idempotent path for normal submitted work

### Requirement: Gates SHALL read submitted work-unit ledger coverage

Delegated gate coverage SHALL come only from Engine-written work-unit rows in bundle-root `rb_output_declarations.jsonl`. Bundle-root `_work_units/_index.json`, manifest, result, receipt, beacon, cache, and output files SHALL be cross-check surfaces, not independent pass coverage.

Current specs, docs, tests, and playbooks SHALL NOT present retired delegated files, old result references, retired commit/merge events, or old delegated queue completion as alternate gate coverage.

#### Scenario: filesystem-only delegated output cannot pass

- **WHEN** a delegated output file exists without submitted work-unit ledger coverage
- **THEN** the gate SHALL fail delegated coverage
- **AND** the file MAY be reported as cleanup or bypass diagnostic evidence only

#### Scenario: old delegated surface is rejected or removed

- **WHEN** a current diagnostic names a retired delegated artifact outside `openspec/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** the diagnostic SHALL frame it as rejected, removed, deprecated, or non-authoritative evidence
- **AND** it SHALL NOT describe that artifact as a production success path

### Requirement: Work-unit tasks SHALL expose bundle-root absolute paths and write-before-return verification

Generated work-unit task Markdown and any Agent-facing claim/spawn output SHALL include the active bundle root as an absolute `bundle_dir`, the exact work-unit identity fields, bundle-relative canonical refs, and absolute paths for files the sub-agent must read or write. The task SHALL instruct the sub-agent to resolve every runtime write under `bundle_dir`, preserve identity fields exactly, and verify required outputs before returning control.

The required verification SHALL cover declared `writes_to` outputs, `result.json`, `runtime-receipt.jsonl`, and cache leaf files required by the work-unit cache policy. A sub-agent that cannot write or verify the files SHALL report work-unit failure rather than returning only research text.

#### Scenario: Claimed task contains absolute runtime paths

- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit claim` creates a work unit for active bundle `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **THEN** the generated task SHALL include `bundle_dir: /repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **AND** it SHALL include absolute paths for `_beacon.json`, `result.json`, `runtime-receipt.jsonl`, declared output files, and required cache leaf directories
- **AND** bundle-relative paths SHALL remain clearly labeled as refs relative to `bundle_dir`

#### Scenario: Sub-agent must verify writes before returning

- **WHEN** a sub-agent completes a work-unit task
- **THEN** the task contract SHALL require it to verify every declared output file exists under active bundle root
- **AND** it SHALL require `result.json` and `runtime-receipt.jsonl` to contain the exact `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, and `receipt_nonce`
- **AND** it SHALL require cache trail leaves to contain required files before the sub-agent returns success

#### Scenario: Chat-only completion is not successful delegated completion

- **WHEN** a sub-agent returns research findings in conversation text but does not write the required result, receipt, output, and cache files
- **THEN** the work unit SHALL remain unsubmitted or submit SHALL reject it
- **AND** the Phase Agent SHALL treat the return as work-unit failure or repair input, not delegated completion

### Requirement: Submitted result and ledger hashes SHALL detect post-submit drift before gate pass

After successful work-unit submit, submitted ledger rows SHALL preserve enough binding hashes and refs for later gate or preflight checks to detect post-submit mutation. A gate that consumes delegated coverage SHALL cross-check the current result, manifest, beacon, runtime receipt, output files, cache trail leaves, index entry, and ledger row against the submitted binding data before it can pass.

If a result file, receipt, output declaration, cache trail, or binding surface drifts after submit, the gate SHALL fail closed with a repair-targeted diagnostic. The repair path SHALL NOT be to hand-edit ledger rows or status files.

#### Scenario: Post-submit result mutation fails gate coverage

- **WHEN** a work unit has a submitted ledger row with `result_hash`
- **AND** the current `result.json` content no longer matches the submitted `result_hash`
- **THEN** delegated gate coverage for that work unit SHALL fail
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL name the affected `work_id` and hash drift surface

#### Scenario: Ledger row remains the delegated authority

- **WHEN** a work-unit output file exists but the submitted ledger row is missing or fails binding cross-check
- **THEN** the output SHALL NOT count as delegated gate coverage
- **AND** diagnostics MAY report the file as cleanup, bypass, or drift evidence only

#### Scenario: Hash drift repair avoids hand-written ledger mutation

- **WHEN** a gate reports submitted result hash mismatch
- **THEN** advice SHALL direct repair through a valid work-unit retry, replacement submit, or explicit terminal/retry operation
- **AND** advice SHALL NOT tell the Agent to edit `rb_output_declarations.jsonl` by hand

### Requirement: Successful work-unit submit SHALL verify durable queue postconditions

After `operate-work-unit submit` accepts a delegated result and before it reports success, the Engine SHALL reload or otherwise verify durable queue state from `rb_queue.json`. A successful submit SHALL prove that the bound `queue_item_id` is absent from `delegated_in_flight` and represented in `terminal_history` with the submitted `work_id`.

If the ledger/index/result transition succeeded but the durable queue postcondition cannot be proven, submit SHALL fail closed with structured diagnostics naming the missing queue postcondition. Where practical, submit SHALL restore the prior durable state; if rollback cannot be proven, diagnostics SHALL mark the work-unit/queue completion state as suspect. It SHALL NOT leave the Agent with a successful submit response and stale in-flight queue state.

#### Scenario: Submit proves in-flight binding was cleared

- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit submit` succeeds for work unit `wu-w0-b000-src-i0001`
- **THEN** reloaded `rb_queue.json.delegated_in_flight` SHALL NOT contain the submitted `queue_item_id`
- **AND** `rb_queue.json.terminal_history` SHALL contain a terminal record binding that `queue_item_id` to `wu-w0-b000-src-i0001`

#### Scenario: Submit fails if queue postcondition is missing

- **WHEN** submit cannot verify that the queue item left `delegated_in_flight`
- **THEN** the submit command SHALL return a structured failure
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL instruct the Agent to repair through Engine queue/work-unit tooling rather than editing `rb_queue.json` by hand

#### Scenario: Submit rollback failure is diagnosed

- **WHEN** submit detects a missing queue postcondition after partially writing work-unit or ledger state
- **AND** the prior durable state cannot be fully restored
- **THEN** submit SHALL return a structured failure that marks work-unit/queue state as suspect
- **AND** it SHALL NOT print a successful submit result

### Requirement: Work-unit submit SHALL canonicalize only bounded LLM-shaped submit drift before strict validation

`operate-work-unit submit` SHALL run a narrow canonicalization step before strict result, receipt, output, cache, nonce, queue, hash, and ledger validation. Canonicalization SHALL be limited to predictable LLM-shaped drift that can be safely tied back to the claimed work-unit record. It SHALL NOT create new authority, bypass work-unit identity, accept path escapes, or relax downstream ledger/gate coverage.

Allowed canonicalization is limited to:

- unwrapping a submitted JSON object whose only top-level key is `result`;
- filling missing receipt schema version with the current receipt-event schema literal, and filling missing receipt binding identity fields from the claimed work-unit record when the receipt event is otherwise valid JSON and has no conflicting identity values;
- materializing `page-content.md` as canonical `page.md` inside the same declared cache leaf when the canonical page file is missing, or accepting an identical non-authority sidecar when both files exist;
- replacing a stale result/receipt `receipt_nonce` with the Engine record nonce only when `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, and `kind` all match the claimed record and the submitted result path resolves inside that work unit's assigned directory.

Accepted submit transactions SHALL persist canonical authority surfaces before reporting success: assigned `result.json` SHALL contain the canonical flat result, assigned `runtime-receipt.jsonl` SHALL contain canonical receipt events, declared cache leaves SHALL contain canonical `page.md`, and ledger rows SHALL be built from canonical data. Any normalization SHALL be visible through structured diagnostics in submit output, trace, log, or an equivalent Engine diagnostic surface. Invalid submit SHALL remain non-terminal and SHALL NOT append a ledger row or complete queue demand.

This requirement SHALL NOT remove the existing ability to submit a candidate `resultPath` from a temporary or caller-provided location when all identity fields already match. The stricter assigned-directory containment check applies only to nonce correction. In every successful case, the Engine SHALL still persist the accepted canonical result to the assigned work-unit `result_ref`.

#### Scenario: single result wrapper is unwrapped

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit submits `result.json` whose top-level object is exactly `{ "result": { ... } }`
- **AND** the inner object satisfies the normal work-unit result contract after canonicalization
- **THEN** submit SHALL validate the inner object as the canonical result
- **AND** the submitted ledger row SHALL store the flat canonical result binding, not the wrapper
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL record that a result wrapper was unwrapped

#### Scenario: result wrapper with siblings is rejected

- **WHEN** a submitted result object contains top-level `result` plus any sibling key
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the result before ledger append
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL identify the unsafe wrapper shape

#### Scenario: missing receipt schema or binding identity is canonicalized

- **WHEN** `runtime-receipt.jsonl` contains parseable JSON events that omit the current receipt-event `schema_version` or one or more binding identity fields: `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, or `receipt_nonce`
- **AND** the missing binding identity fields can be filled from the claimed work-unit record
- **AND** no present identity field conflicts with that record
- **THEN** submit SHALL validate the canonical receipt events with the filled schema version and binding identity fields
- **AND** the assigned `runtime-receipt.jsonl` SHALL be persisted in canonical JSONL form before submit reports success
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL identify the receipt line numbers and autofilled schema or identity fields

#### Scenario: conflicting receipt schema version is rejected

- **WHEN** a receipt event contains a `schema_version` that is not the current receipt-event schema literal
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the receipt through normal schema validation
- **AND** schema version autofill SHALL NOT be used to rewrite a conflicting version

#### Scenario: conflicting receipt binding identity is rejected

- **WHEN** a receipt event contains a `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, or `receipt_nonce` that conflicts with the claimed work-unit record
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the receipt
- **AND** no queue completion or ledger append SHALL occur

#### Scenario: invalid or empty receipt remains invalid

- **WHEN** `runtime-receipt.jsonl` is empty or contains invalid JSONL
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the receipt
- **AND** receipt canonicalization SHALL NOT be used to synthesize missing events or repair malformed JSON

#### Scenario: page-content cache leaf is canonicalized

- **WHEN** a declared cache leaf contains `websearch.json`, `meta.json`, and `page-content.md`
- **AND** `page.md` is absent in that same leaf directory
- **THEN** submit SHALL materialize canonical `page.md` with the `page-content.md` content before cache validation reports success
- **AND** cache validation SHALL continue against `page.md`
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL identify the cache leaf canonicalization

#### Scenario: identical page sidecar is accepted as non-authority

- **WHEN** a declared cache leaf contains both `page.md` and `page-content.md`
- **AND** their content is identical
- **THEN** submit SHALL validate `page.md` as the canonical authority file
- **AND** `page-content.md` SHALL NOT be treated as an additional fetched-source authority surface

#### Scenario: divergent page files are rejected

- **WHEN** a declared cache leaf contains both `page.md` and `page-content.md`
- **AND** their content differs
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the cache trail
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL identify the divergent files

#### Scenario: cache authority files remain required

- **WHEN** a declared cache leaf is missing `websearch.json`, missing `meta.json`, or has neither `page.md` nor canonicalizable `page-content.md`
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the cache trail
- **AND** no fetched-source output SHALL gain ledger coverage from that leaf

#### Scenario: nonce is normalized only under complete binding

- **WHEN** a result or receipt carries a stale `receipt_nonce`
- **AND** `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, and `kind` match the claimed work-unit record
- **AND** the submitted result path resolves inside that work unit's assigned directory
- **THEN** submit MAY normalize the nonce to the Engine record nonce before strict validation
- **AND** assigned `result.json` and `runtime-receipt.jsonl` SHALL persist the canonical record nonce before submit reports success
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL record the nonce normalization

#### Scenario: nonce mismatch with unsafe binding is rejected

- **WHEN** a result or receipt nonce differs from the claimed record
- **AND** any other identity field differs or the result path resolves outside the assigned work-unit directory
- **THEN** submit SHALL reject the submission
- **AND** no ledger row SHALL be written

#### Scenario: exact-identity candidate result may come from temporary path

- **WHEN** a submitted candidate result path is outside the assigned work-unit directory
- **AND** `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, and `receipt_nonce` already match the claimed work-unit record
- **AND** all other result, receipt, output, cache, queue, hash, and ledger validations pass
- **THEN** submit MAY accept the candidate result using the existing submit path semantics
- **AND** the Engine SHALL persist the canonical accepted result to the assigned work-unit `result_ref`

### Requirement: Work-unit dry-submit SHALL preflight submit validation without side effects

The work-unit CLI SHALL provide a dry-submit preflight for claimed work units. Dry-submit SHALL read a candidate result and evaluate the same deterministic submit contract used by formal `operate-work-unit submit` wherever possible, including work-unit identity, queue binding, manifest/index consistency, result schema, runtime receipt, nonce, output files, source claims, cache trails, and kind output contract constraints.

Dry-submit SHALL be read-only. It SHALL NOT append `rb_output_declarations.jsonl`, complete queue demand, mutate `rb_queue.json`, change work-unit terminal/claimed status, write canonical result/receipt/cache files, record `last_submit_rejection`, create `_work_units/_transactions/` entries, write submit trace/log side effects, or emit success authority that gates may consume. Formal submit remains the only successful delegated completion transition.

Dry-submit output SHALL be structured enough for Agent repair. It SHALL report whether formal submit is expected to pass, the checked `work_id`, reason codes or violation codes, repair-targeted diagnostics, and any narrow normalizations formal submit would perform. Failed dry-submit SHALL still return structured preflight JSON rather than only throwing a stderr error. Normalization reporting SHALL NOT persist those normalizations during dry-submit.

Dry-submit SHALL mirror formal submit candidate path semantics. A candidate result path MAY be temporary or caller-provided when formal submit would allow it. The assigned work-unit directory containment rule SHALL remain limited to nonce normalization eligibility and SHALL NOT become a new dry-submit-only path restriction.

Dry-submit SHALL avoid validation branches that write as part of canonicalization. When formal submit would canonicalize cache `page-content.md` into `page.md`, canonical receipt JSONL, or assigned result JSON, dry-submit SHALL report the planned normalization without writing those files. Dry-submit SHALL validate the in-memory virtual canonical view that formal submit would validate, so read-only preflight does not reject a candidate solely because the canonical file has not been persisted yet.

Dry-submit SHALL accumulate independently evaluable violations so the Agent can repair multiple issues in one pass. If one failed check prevents dependent checks from running, dry-submit SHALL report that dependency rather than inventing validation results.

#### Scenario: valid dry-submit has no ledger side effect

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a candidate result that formal submit would accept
- **AND** the Agent runs `operate-work-unit dry-submit`
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL return `ok: true` or equivalent pass status
- **AND** `rb_output_declarations.jsonl`, `rb_queue.json`, work-unit status, assigned `result.json`, runtime receipt files, `_work_units/_transactions/`, trace/log files, and existing cache leaf files SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: dry-submit reports multiple repairable violations

- **WHEN** a candidate result has an invalid output role and a missing cache trail file
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL report both violations when both can be evaluated independently
- **AND** the diagnostic SHALL identify the output role problem and the cache trail repair target
- **AND** no ledger row or queue completion SHALL occur

#### Scenario: dry-submit reports normalizations without persisting them

- **WHEN** a candidate result uses a shape that formal submit would narrow-canonicalize
- **THEN** dry-submit MAY report the planned normalization
- **AND** it SHALL NOT write the canonicalized result, receipt, trace/log record, or cache surface
- **AND** formal submit SHALL still be required to persist any accepted canonical authority surface

#### Scenario: dry-submit does not materialize cache page aliases

- **WHEN** a cache trail has `page-content.md` that formal submit would canonicalize to `page.md`
- **AND** the Agent runs `operate-work-unit dry-submit`
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL report the planned cache normalization when relevant
- **AND** it SHALL validate the virtual `page.md` content that formal submit would materialize
- **AND** it SHALL NOT create or overwrite `page.md`
- **AND** a later formal submit SHALL still be required to persist the canonical cache leaf

#### Scenario: failed dry-submit does not mark submit rejection

- **WHEN** dry-submit finds a candidate result invalid
- **THEN** the work-unit attempt SHALL remain repairable without a submit rejection state change caused by dry-submit
- **AND** a later corrected dry-submit or formal submit MAY be attempted for the same claimed `work_id`

#### Scenario: dry-submit cannot satisfy gate coverage

- **WHEN** a work unit has only a successful dry-submit and no formal submit ledger row
- **THEN** wave gates SHALL NOT count that work unit as delegated coverage
- **AND** diagnostics MAY mention that formal submit is still required

#### Scenario: dry-submit accepts caller-provided candidate path under submit-equivalent rules

- **WHEN** a candidate result path is outside the assigned work-unit directory
- **AND** all identity fields already match the claimed work-unit record
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL evaluate it under the same path semantics as formal submit
- **AND** it SHALL NOT require the candidate to be copied into the assigned work-unit directory before preflight

### Requirement: Timeout terminalization SHALL be guarded by progress-aware preflight

The work-unit CLI SHALL provide a timeout preflight for claimed work units. Timeout preflight SHALL determine whether it is safe to terminalize a claimed work-unit attempt as `timed_out` by evaluating Engine-observed progress, candidate result state, dry-submit-equivalent diagnostics, queue binding, and effective idle lease state.

Timeout preflight SHALL accept an explicit active bundle path, `work_id`, and optional candidate `result` path. When no candidate result path is supplied, preflight SHALL inspect the assigned result path from the work-unit record. When a candidate result path is supplied, preflight SHALL evaluate it under submit/dry-submit-equivalent candidate path rules. A supplied candidate result path outside the assigned work-unit directory SHALL be a validation input only: its mtime SHALL NOT extend the work-unit idle lease by itself, though dry-submit-equivalent validation MAY still recommend `submit` or `repair`. It SHALL fail closed for missing or invalid work-unit index records, non-claimed attempts, missing manifests, missing queue in-flight binding, or binding drift. It SHALL return structured JSON for both timeout-eligible and timeout-ineligible cases. The output SHALL include the checked `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, current status, `timeout_eligible`, `check`, `recommended_action`, progress summary, `initial_deadline_at`, `lease_anchor_at`, `idle_timeout_ms`, `effective_timeout_at`, `inspect[]`, and repair-oriented `advice[]`.

`recommended_action` SHALL be a closed value: `submit`, `repair`, `wait`, `timeout`, `inspect`, or `block`. Timeout-preflight CLI exit status SHALL follow `timeout_eligible`: exit success only when timeout is currently safe, and exit non-zero when timeout is unsafe or the work-unit state is invalid. When the work-unit context can be loaded, non-zero preflight outcomes SHALL still emit structured JSON for Agent feedback.

Timeout-preflight output SHALL be validated by an Engine-owned schema before it is emitted. The schema SHALL make `timeout_eligible` and `check` consistent, SHALL constrain `recommended_action` to the closed action set, and SHALL keep progress details structured enough for tests and Phase Agent guidance to distinguish result, receipt, output/cache, idle lease, and binding diagnostics.

The timeout-preflight helper/API SHALL accept an injectable clock for tests, while CLI invocations SHALL use the real current time. Tests SHALL NOT depend on sleeping to cross timeout boundaries. Filesystem mtime comparisons SHALL be made against the injected or real current time and the work-unit `claimed_at`. File mtimes in the future relative to the chosen current time SHALL be diagnosed as suspicious and SHALL NOT extend the effective lease beyond the chosen current time plus the idle timeout window.

Timeout eligibility SHALL be progress-aware. The existing `deadline_at` SHALL remain an initial lease hint, but terminal timeout eligibility SHALL use an effective idle lease derived from `lease_anchor_at + idle_timeout_ms`. `latest_engine_observed_progress_at` SHALL mean actual Engine-observed progress and SHALL NOT be populated from `claimed_at` merely to support timeout arithmetic. `lease_anchor_at` SHALL be the latest Engine-observed progress time when progress exists, or `claimed_at` when no progress exists. The default idle timeout window SHALL be the work-unit `timeout_ms` unless an accepted explicit runtime/profile surface provides a narrower value. If there is no observed progress after claim, effective timeout eligibility SHALL fall back to `claimed_at + idle_timeout_ms`, which matches the existing `claimed_at + timeout_ms` behavior when the default idle timeout is used.

Engine-observed progress SHALL come from deterministic bundle-root surfaces such as assigned candidate result files, runtime receipt/log content and mtime tied to the same identity, declared output/cache files under active bundle root, assigned work-unit refs, and Engine trace/log events tied to the same `work_id`. Undeclared random files, path-escape refs, and identity-mismatched surfaces SHALL NOT extend the idle lease. Agent-authored receipt timestamps SHALL NOT be the sole authority for progress freshness. Progress diagnostics SHALL identify the source type, observed timestamp when available, path or event ref when available, whether work-unit identity was verified, whether the source extended the idle lease, and whether a suspicious timestamp was detected.

Timeout preflight SHALL be read-only by default. It SHALL NOT update work-unit index records, queue state, work-unit status files, submitted ledger rows, terminal history, retry demand, transaction directories, trace/log files, candidate result files, runtime receipts, cache aliases, or gate-consumable outputs. Any future persisted observation surface such as `last_observed_at` SHALL require explicit design/spec update and no-authority side-effect proof before implementation relies on it.

If a candidate result exists, timeout preflight SHALL run dry-submit-equivalent validation before recommending timeout. If dry-submit would pass, preflight SHALL recommend formal `submit` and SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`. If dry-submit fails with repair diagnostics for the same claimed `work_id`, preflight SHALL recommend repair and SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`. Wrong identity, missing binding, terminal status, and ambiguous authority diagnostics SHALL route to `inspect` or `block`, not same-attempt repair. If recent progress exists but no candidate result is ready, preflight SHALL recommend wait or inspect and SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false` while the effective idle lease has not expired.

`operate-work-unit timeout` SHALL run the same preflight guard by default. Default timeout SHALL refuse progress-positive, submit-ready, repairable, or not-yet-idle attempts without changing work-unit status, queue state, ledger rows, terminal history, retry demand, trace/log terminalization records, transaction directories, or gate coverage. Timeout SHALL proceed by default only when preflight returns timeout-eligible.

Any Engine-owned timeout terminalization path SHALL run the same preflight guard by default, including exported lifecycle/API helpers used by the CLI or tests. The implementation SHALL NOT leave an unguarded exported path that can set a claimed attempt to `timed_out`. `failed` and `abandoned` terminalization are not governed by timeout-preflight unless a separate accepted change says otherwise.

The timeout command and Engine/API timeout path SHALL expose explicit force terminalization. Forced timeout SHALL still run preflight for audit, but MAY bypass a false timeout eligibility check. Forced timeout SHALL require a reason and SHALL produce durable diagnostics that include `forced_timeout: true`, the reason, `preflight_timeout_eligible`, `preflight_recommended_action`, `default_timeout_would_refuse`, `effective_timeout_at`, `latest_engine_observed_progress_at`, `lease_anchor_at`, and structured `progress_sources[]`. Each `progress_sources[]` item SHALL include source type, observed timestamp when available, path or event ref when available, identity verification, lease-extension status, and suspicious timestamp flag. The preferred trace event name for a forced bypass is `work_unit_forced_timeout`; if implementation extends the existing timeout event instead, it SHALL include the same required fields. Forced timeout SHALL still be terminal fail-closed: it SHALL NOT append a submitted ledger row, SHALL NOT count as delegated gate coverage, and normal late submit against the terminal attempt SHALL remain rejected.

#### Scenario: no-progress claimed attempt is timeout eligible

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has no candidate result, an empty or missing runtime receipt, no observed output/cache progress, and its effective idle lease has expired
- **THEN** `operate-work-unit timeout-preflight` SHALL return `timeout_eligible: true`
- **AND** `recommended_action` SHALL be `timeout`
- **AND** default `operate-work-unit timeout`, when invoked for that eligible attempt, SHALL be allowed to terminalize the attempt through the existing timeout retry path

#### Scenario: timeout preflight is read-only

- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit timeout-preflight` is run for a claimed work unit
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT mutate work-unit index, queue, status, ledger, transaction, trace/log, receipt, result, cache, or gate-consumable output surfaces
- **AND** any later formal submit or terminal command SHALL see the same authority state that existed before preflight

#### Scenario: injected clock makes timeout deterministic

- **WHEN** timeout-preflight is called through the helper/API with an injected current time
- **THEN** effective timeout calculations SHALL use that injected time
- **AND** tests SHALL be able to prove eligible and non-eligible outcomes without sleeping or relying on wall-clock delays

#### Scenario: no-progress lease anchor is not reported as observed progress

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has no Engine-observed progress after claim
- **THEN** timeout-preflight SHALL compute `lease_anchor_at` from `claimed_at`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT report `claimed_at` as `latest_engine_observed_progress_at`
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL still expose the effective timeout calculation anchor

#### Scenario: future mtime does not overextend lease

- **WHEN** a progress source has filesystem mtime later than the chosen current time
- **THEN** timeout-preflight SHALL diagnose the timestamp as suspicious
- **AND** it SHALL NOT extend the effective lease beyond the chosen current time plus the idle timeout window

#### Scenario: external candidate result does not extend lease by mtime alone

- **WHEN** timeout-preflight is called with `--result <candidate>` outside the assigned work-unit directory
- **THEN** the candidate SHALL be evaluated for submit or repair advice under dry-submit-equivalent rules
- **AND** the candidate file mtime alone SHALL NOT extend the work-unit idle lease

#### Scenario: recent receipt progress blocks default timeout

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a non-empty runtime receipt tied to the same work-unit identity
- **AND** Engine-observed receipt progress is within the effective idle lease
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** default timeout SHALL refuse terminalization
- **AND** no retry demand or terminal history row SHALL be created by the refused timeout

#### Scenario: output or cache progress blocks default timeout

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has observed output or cache files under the assigned work-unit contract
- **AND** the latest Engine-observed progress is within the effective idle lease
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** advice SHALL direct the Agent to wait, inspect, repair, or submit rather than timeout

#### Scenario: submit-ready result is recommended for submit

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a candidate result that dry-submit would accept
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** `recommended_action` SHALL be `submit`
- **AND** advice SHALL instruct formal `operate-work-unit submit` for the same `work_id`
- **AND** no timeout retry SHALL be created by default timeout

#### Scenario: repairable result is recommended for same-attempt repair

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a candidate result that dry-submit rejects with repair diagnostics
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** `recommended_action` SHALL be `repair`
- **AND** advice SHALL target repair of the same claimed `work_id`
- **AND** the attempt SHALL remain claimed unless the Agent later explicitly terminalizes it

#### Scenario: invalid candidate identity is not treated as same-attempt repair

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a candidate result whose dry-submit diagnostics show wrong `work_id`, missing queue binding, terminal status, or ambiguous authority rather than same-attempt repair
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** `recommended_action` SHALL be `inspect` or `block`
- **AND** default timeout SHALL NOT terminalize the attempt

#### Scenario: stale progress may become timeout eligible

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has prior observed progress
- **AND** no candidate result is submit-ready or repairable
- **AND** the effective idle lease from the latest Engine-observed progress has expired
- **THEN** timeout preflight SHALL return `timeout_eligible: true` unless another fail-closed invalid-binding or ambiguous-state diagnostic applies
- **AND** diagnostics SHALL include the latest observed progress time and effective timeout time

#### Scenario: default timeout refusal has no terminal side effect

- **WHEN** default `operate-work-unit timeout` is invoked for a progress-positive timeout-ineligible work unit
- **THEN** the command SHALL return structured failure
- **AND** work-unit index/status, queue delegated in-flight binding, queue terminal history, retry demand, submitted ledger rows, transaction directory entries, trace/log terminalization records, and gate coverage SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: exported timeout API uses the same guard

- **WHEN** an Engine caller invokes an exported lifecycle/API timeout path for a progress-positive timeout-ineligible work unit
- **THEN** the same preflight guard SHALL refuse terminalization
- **AND** there SHALL be no unguarded exported helper that can set the attempt to `timed_out`
- **AND** `failed` and `abandoned` terminalization behavior SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: timeout bypass audit covers Engine-owned terminalization paths

- **WHEN** implementation exposes or retains any Engine-owned helper that can terminalize a work unit as `timed_out`
- **THEN** regression or hygiene coverage SHALL prove that helper routes through guarded timeout or explicit forced timeout
- **AND** direct `timed_out` mutation paths SHALL NOT remain available as exported lifecycle/API shortcuts

#### Scenario: forced timeout is auditable

- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit timeout --force` terminalizes a progress-positive claimed work unit
- **THEN** the command SHALL require a reason
- **AND** durable trace/log or equivalent diagnostics SHALL record `forced_timeout: true`, the reason, `preflight_timeout_eligible`, `preflight_recommended_action`, `default_timeout_would_refuse`, `effective_timeout_at`, `latest_engine_observed_progress_at`, `lease_anchor_at`, and structured `progress_sources[]`
- **AND** a forced bypass SHOULD be visible as `work_unit_forced_timeout` or an equivalent existing timeout event carrying the same required fields
- **AND** the resulting terminal attempt SHALL still reject normal late submit

#### Scenario: invalid binding fails closed

- **WHEN** timeout preflight finds missing manifest, missing queue in-flight binding, mismatched `queue_item_id`, or non-claimed status
- **THEN** it SHALL return `timeout_eligible: false`
- **AND** advice SHALL direct inspection or Engine repair
- **AND** default timeout SHALL NOT terminalize the attempt
