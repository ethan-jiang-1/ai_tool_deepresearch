# Pre-Research Phase Content

> req: PRP-001, PRP-002, PRP-003, PRP-004, PRP-005, PRP-006, PRP-007, PRP-008, PRP-009, PRP-010, PRP-011

## Purpose

定义 instantiation、HITL1、setup 三个 phase node 的完整 body 内容要求。每个 phase node body 必须满足当前 workflow-node contract 的 9 个 section，同时严格贴合当前 accepted CLI / schema / bundle contract：instantiation 通过真实 CLI 建 bundle；HITL1 的 runtime truth 写进 `rb_profile.yaml`；setup 只做 structural consistency，不膨胀成 readiness。
## Requirements
### Requirement: Phase instantiation body completeness

`phase-instantiation.md` SHALL 包含完整的 9-section body，引导 Agent 创建真实 runtime bundle。

Section 内容要求：
- **Stage Goal**: 创建 bundle 和 canonical scaffold，不替代后续 HITL / setup / wave
- **Required Inputs**: 用户原始 research question（用于命名）和 `DPT_FRAMEWORK/cli/instantiate-run-bundle.mjs`
- **Allowed Actions**:
  - 生成合适的 bundle 名
  - 调用 `node DPT_FRAMEWORK/cli/instantiate-run-bundle.mjs <name>`
  - 读取 CLI 返回的 bundle 路径
  - reload 新建 bundle 的 control files 和目录结构
- **Expected Artifacts**: 新建 bundle 目录、`BUNDLE_MAP.md`、5 个 `rb_*` control files、canonical scaffold dirs
- **Gate Command**: `node DPT_FRAMEWORK/cli/gates/check-gate-instantiation-complete.mjs --bundle <path> --current-node phases/phase-instantiation.md`
- **On Gate Pass**: 读取 `check.next`
- **On Gate Fail**: 读取 `inspect` / `advice`，修复缺失或漂移的 instantiation surface，rerun same gate（默认最多 3 次）
- **Stop Behavior**: `stop: no`
- **Anti-Cheating Rules**: 禁止跳过 CLI 直接手搓"看起来像 bundle"的结果；禁止声称 evidence coverage / synthesis

`phase-instantiation.md` SHALL describe `BUNDLE_MAP.md` as a passive bundle map. It SHALL NOT instruct the Agent to treat the bundle map as an action launcher or phase-control surface.

#### Scenario: Agent executes instantiation phase

- **WHEN** Agent 加载 `phase-instantiation.md`
- **THEN** body SHALL 引导 Agent 调用 `instantiate-run-bundle.mjs`
- **AND** body SHALL NOT 指示 Agent 在这个阶段提 HITL 问题或做 research work

#### Scenario: Instantiation expected artifacts use bundle map

- **WHEN** Agent reads the Expected Artifacts section
- **THEN** it SHALL see `BUNDLE_MAP.md`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT see `START_FROM_HERE.md` as the current expected artifact for new bundles

### Requirement: Phase HITL1 body completeness and stop semantics

`phase-hitl1.md` SHALL contain the complete 9-section body, retain `stop: yes`, and declare `execution_contract.search_policy: capability_probe_only`.

Section requirements:

- **Stage Goal**: turn the original question into one Agent-recommended research starting point, accept the user's natural-language acceptance or correction, confirm actual research access, and commit approved canonical topic intent.
- **Required Inputs**: instantiated bundle and `shared-profile.md`.
- **Allowed Actions**:
  - read the original research question/brief and decide whether topic rewrite is needed;
  - write structured original-topic narrative to `rb_plan.md` body without inventing missing user constraints;
  - derive an Agent-facing preview of initial topics, proposed must-answer set, and one recommended research profile/depth/breadth with a reason and expected effort impact;
  - show original topic + topic preview + recommendation-first HITL1 alignment surface to the user and wait for a natural-language acceptance, correction, question, or optional shortcut choice;
  - consume the existing HITL1 entry path and establish `current_node: phases/phase-hitl1.md`, `current_gate: hitl1_recorded`, `next_gate: setup_ready` before topic mutation;
  - only inside that accepted HITL1 decision window, map the user's clear acceptance or correction to the existing profile/topic fields; do not treat ordinary messages outside HITL1 as persisted HITL1 intent or mutation authority;
  - when the user's semantics are clear, treat that answer as confirmation and do not require a blanket second confirmation; ask only the minimum question needed for substantive ambiguity, real cost/permission expansion, or irreversible risk;
  - after the user's decision, write a retained topic-state input file containing `add_topic` entries with title, descriptive slug stem, must-answer set, scope role and dependencies;
  - run one `operate-topic-state apply` change set so the approved canonical registry and all UID-bound seed skeletons commit together; do not directly write registry frontmatter or defer approved intent to the seed phase;
  - select the `research_profile` enum and write `root_must_answer_set` from the accepted recommendation/correction;
  - write `human_decision_checkpoints.hitl1.status` and `.recorded_at`;
  - run `apply-research-style.mjs` using committed registry count;
  - execute at most one neutral capability-only search and at most one fetch of the first usable HTTP(S) result, then record direct `research_access` observation.
- **Expected Artifacts**: canonical `rb_plan.md` registry, matching UID-bound seeds, and `rb_profile.yaml` containing user choices, style parameters, HITL1 marker and research-access observation.
- **Gate Command**: existing `check-gate-hitl1-recorded.mjs` under the current node.
- **On Gate Pass**: read `check.next`.
- **On Gate Fail**: read inspect/advice, repair the one direct blocker and rerun the same command/gate; if access is unavailable, preserve choices, repair/switch environment, and rerun the same bounded probe and gate.
- **Stop Behavior**: wait for the user's research semantic decision at HITL1; a clear acceptance or correction satisfies that human decision boundary, after which Agent executes ordinary apply/style/probe/Gate commands without returning each mechanical step to the user.
- **Anti-Cheating Rules**: no chat-only answers, fake probe, direct registry edit, seed-only identity, mock access, parallel status tree, automatic retry tree, invented user semantics, or treating non-HITL chat as HITL1 mutation authority.

Probe SHALL remain bounded to one search invocation and one fetch invocation. It SHALL answer only whether the first usable HTTP(S) result from a neutral capability-only search can be fetched as page content. Search unavailable/failed/blocked/no usable result, or a missing fetch surface before invocation, SHALL record `unavailable` with `fetch_outcome: not_attempted`; an attempted blocked/failed fetch SHALL record the corresponding non-success outcome; only real fetched page content permits `available`.

Probe URL/content SHALL NOT become research evidence, cache, submitted output, receipt or gate coverage. HITL1 SHALL NOT create offline research artifacts, fake probe receipts, evidence-free report skeletons, automatic retry trees or another interactive checkpoint. User choices and research access SHALL remain in the accepted profile surface, not a parallel status tree.

HITL1 natural-language mapping SHALL be a prompt-side Agent responsibility within the existing `stop: yes` boundary, not a new Engine authority or generic conversation interceptor. It SHALL NOT persist, queue, or apply a user's voluntary message from a later `stop: no` phase, and SHALL NOT create pause, reentry, permission or mutation capability.

HITL1 gate SHALL require `CanonicalPlanSchema`, exact UID-bound seed projection and completed topic-state workspace state. Legacy-compatible plan readability SHALL not count as HITL1 completion. The Agent SHALL run the existing gate after user input; `stop: yes` does not waive deterministic checks.

Initial topic-state apply SHALL run only after `enter-phase` has populated `rb_status.json#/current_node: phases/phase-hitl1.md` and the existing bootstrap-compatible status synchronization has established `current_gate: hitl1_recorded` / `next_gate: setup_ready`. The apply context argument is descriptive only; it SHALL NOT authorize mutation when those direct lifecycle facts are absent or stale.

#### Scenario: User approves initial topics and Agent materializes them
- **WHEN** HITL1 has presented a complete recommendation and the user answers “按这个开始” or otherwise clearly approves the proposed topic semantics
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL treat that answer as confirmation, write retained apply input and immediately run topic-state apply
- **AND** it SHALL NOT ask the user to repeat the same choice through a letter menu or second confirmation
- **AND** canonical registry plus UID-bound seeds SHALL commit before style computation and gate pass

#### Scenario: User corrects the recommendation and Agent preserves the rest
- **WHEN** the user clearly corrects one part of the recommendation, such as “范围不变，但重点放资本约束”
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL update the affected proposed topic/must-answer semantics and preserve the uncorrected parts
- **AND** it SHALL NOT invent additional constraints or require another confirmation when the corrected intent is clear
- **AND** it SHALL perform retained apply, style, probe and Gate mechanics itself

#### Scenario: HITL1 keeps user responsibility semantic
- **WHEN** topic intent is clear from the user's acceptance or correction
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL run apply/style/probe/gate without asking the user to execute commands
- **AND** it SHALL not ask the user to confirm the same clear semantics again
- **AND** it SHALL ask again only for genuinely unresolved semantics, real cost/permission expansion or irreversible risk

#### Scenario: Declared HITL1 context is not mutation authority
- **WHEN** an apply request declares HITL1 but `current_node` or the accepted HITL1 status window does not match
- **THEN** apply SHALL reject before workspace creation without changing plan, seed, profile, status or trace
- **AND** the Agent SHALL restore or re-enter the existing legal lifecycle path rather than request a bypass

#### Scenario: Plan-first crash fails at one prerequisite
- **WHEN** an accepted topic-state workspace remains after plan replacement and before seed completion
- **THEN** HITL1 gate SHALL report the workspace/seed prerequisite and exact recover action
- **AND** SHALL short-circuit derivative profile/count/seed-floor symptoms

#### Scenario: Available access uses real probe only
- **WHEN** actual search returns a usable HTTP(S) URL and actual fetch returns page content
- **THEN** HITL1 SHALL record the accepted available observation and SHALL NOT count probe output as evidence

#### Scenario: Unavailable access remains at HITL1
- **WHEN** search/fetch is absent, blocked, fails or returns no usable page
- **THEN** HITL1 SHALL record the unavailable observation, preserve user choices and remain in HITL1

#### Scenario: HITL1 writes accepted surfaces not status tree
- **WHEN** HITL1 records topic intent, user choices and capability observation
- **THEN** identity/intent SHALL be in canonical plan+seed and choices/access SHALL be in `rb_profile.yaml`
- **AND** HITL1 SHALL NOT create `rb_status.json#/phases/hitl1/*` or another research-access/topic status tree

#### Scenario: Ordinary mid-run message cannot reuse HITL1 mapping authority
- **WHEN** a user voluntarily sends a message while a later `stop: no` phase is executing
- **THEN** PRP-002 SHALL NOT authorize writing that message into HITL1 profile/topic owners or running topic-state mutation from the message alone
- **AND** the message SHALL NOT create a new HITL checkpoint, permission source, pause state or interrupt lifecycle

### Requirement: Phase setup body completeness and stop semantics

`phase-setup.md` SHALL 包含完整的 9-section body，并保留 `stop: no`。

Section 内容要求：
- **Stage Goal**: 验证 bundle 在进入 wave0 前的 structural consistency
- **Required Inputs**: active bundle、`shared-profile.md`、`shared-schemas.md`
- **Allowed Actions**:
  - 检查 control files 是否存在且可解析
  - 检查 scaffold dirs 是否存在
  - 检查 HITL1 marker 是否已写入 profile
  - 检查 `rb_status.json` 仍然是 `current_gate: setup_ready` / `next_gate: seed_topics_ready`
  - 按 accepted normalization 规则检查 bundle dir basename、`rb_plan.md` frontmatter `plan_basename`、`rb_profile.yaml` `plan_basename` 一致
- **Expected Artifacts**: 一致的 pre-wave0 bundle surface
- **Gate Command**: `node DPT_FRAMEWORK/cli/gates/check-gate-setup-ready.mjs --bundle <path> --current-node phases/phase-setup.md`
- **On Gate Pass**: 读取 `check.next`
- **On Gate Fail**: 读取 `inspect` / `advice`，修复后 rerun
- **Stop Behavior**: `stop: no`
- **Anti-Cheating Rules**: 禁止把 setup pass 当 readiness pass；禁止手动改状态冒充 ready

#### Scenario: Setup does not become readiness

- **WHEN** `phase-setup.md` 描述检查范围
- **THEN** body SHALL 明确声明 `setup_ready != readiness_passed`
- **AND** body SHALL 限定在结构一致性，不做研究质量判断

#### Scenario: Setup body explains disposable bundle normalization

- **WHEN** `phase-setup.md` 描述 basename consistency
- **THEN** body SHALL 说明 production 使用 `dpt_rb_<name>`，disposable experiment 使用 `dpt_disp_<name>_<hex>`
- **AND** body SHALL 指示 Agent 比较归一化后的 bundle basename 与 plan/profile `plan_basename`

### Requirement: Setup body distinguishes production and disposable naming contracts

`phase-setup.md` SHALL 明确说明当前 accepted name grammar：
- production run logical name 使用 lowercase kebab-case，匹配 `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`
- disposable experiment logical name 使用 lowercase case slug，匹配 `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*`

该说明 SHALL 只解释当前 contract，不引入新的命名接口。

#### Scenario: Setup body documents name grammar

- **WHEN** Agent 读取 `phase-setup.md` 的 basename consistency 部分
- **THEN** body SHALL 说明 production 与 disposable 的 `<name>` 允许字符集不同
- **AND** body SHALL NOT 暗示大写、空格或任意 Unicode 是可接受命名

### Requirement: HITL1 body exposes a concrete payload checklist

`phase-hitl1.md` SHALL expose the minimum write contract as a visible checklist for the human and Agent.

The checklist SHALL include:

- `research_profile`
- `root_must_answer_set`
- `research_style_params`
- `research_access.status`
- available path: `research_access.probed_at`, `research_access.result_url`, `research_access.fetch_outcome: success`
- unavailable path: `research_access.probed_at`, non-success `research_access.fetch_outcome`, `research_access.reason`
- `human_decision_checkpoints.hitl1.status`
- `human_decision_checkpoints.hitl1.recorded_at`

Optional `research_access.search_surface` and `research_access.fetch_surface` labels MAY appear in the checklist but SHALL NOT be presented as gate-required facts. The checklist is an alignment/review surface, not a separate schema authority.

#### Scenario: Human can audit capability readiness

- **WHEN** a human reviewer reads `phase-hitl1.md`
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL see both the normal HITL1 payload and exact available/unavailable observation fields
- **AND** review SHALL not require reconstructing the probe contract from scattered prose

### Requirement: Instantiation scope boundary enforcement

`phase-instantiation.md` SHALL remain limited to naming, invoking the instantiation CLI, and checking the instantiated bundle surface. This requirement narrows how `stop: "no"` instantiation handles name problems: it SHALL resolve ordinary naming problems silently instead of asking the user.

Instantiation completion SHALL mean the instantiated bundle surface has been reloaded, the instantiation gate has passed, and the Agent follows gate CLI `check.next`. Creating the directory or control files is not a user-facing checkpoint. The phase body SHALL NOT allow progress reports such as "bundle created" or idle reports such as "nothing left to do" before the gate pass.

For production bundle name collision, the phase body SHALL instruct the Agent to derive a replacement basename by appending a short deterministic-safe suffix such as `-<hex6>`, record the substitution through an accepted trace/log surface, and continue instantiation without asking the user.

For illegal user-provided basename characters, the phase body SHALL instruct the Agent to normalize the basename into the accepted pattern (for example replacing illegal characters with `-`), record the normalization through an accepted trace/log surface, and continue instantiation without asking the user.

This does not allow unsafe repair of an already-created illegal bundle. The Agent SHALL NOT rename an existing runtime directory, patch `rb_plan.md` / `rb_profile.yaml` to retroactively bless an illegal basename, or treat an invalid existing bundle as valid.

#### Scenario: Name collision uses silent replacement name

- **WHEN** the desired production bundle basename already exists
- **THEN** `phase-instantiation.md` SHALL instruct the Agent to generate a replacement basename with a short suffix
- **AND** the Agent SHALL record the substitution through an accepted trace/log surface
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT stop to ask the user for a new name

#### Scenario: Illegal name is normalized before instantiation

- **WHEN** the requested bundle basename contains illegal characters
- **THEN** `phase-instantiation.md` SHALL instruct the Agent to normalize the basename before creating the bundle
- **AND** the Agent SHALL record the normalization through an accepted trace/log surface
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT stop to ask the user for a replacement name

#### Scenario: Existing illegal bundle is not retroactively repaired

- **WHEN** Agent discovers an already-created bundle basename that violates the accepted pattern
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL NOT rename the existing directory or patch control files to make it look valid
- **AND** any recovery SHALL use a fresh legal instantiation path

#### Scenario: Instantiation does not surface after local creation

- **WHEN** the instantiation CLI creates a bundle directory and control files
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL reload/check the instantiated surface and run the instantiation gate
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT report progress or idle state to the user before gate pass
- **AND** the Agent SHALL advance only via gate CLI `check.next`

### Requirement: HITL1 stop semantics enforcement

`phase-hitl1.md` 的 `stop: yes` SHALL 被正确实现。用户回答后，Agent 仍必须运行 `hitl1-recorded` gate；`stop: yes` 只意味着等待用户，不意味着豁免 deterministic check。

#### Scenario: Stop yes blocks auto-advance

- **WHEN** 用户尚未回答 HITL1
- **THEN** Agent MUST NOT 进入 `phase-setup`

### Requirement: Setup stop semantics enforcement

`phase-setup.md` remains `stop: "no"` and gate pass still auto-advances through gate CLI `check.next`. On persistent setup gate failure, the phase body SHALL no longer instruct user-facing escalation or `rb_status.json` state `blocked`. It SHALL instruct the Agent to record `silent_degradation` through an accepted trace/log surface, preserve `rb_status.json` in an in-progress/non-blocked lifecycle state, and continue repair or gate-respecting degradation without asking the user.

Setup completion SHALL mean `setup-ready` gate pass plus `check.next`, not "validation seems locally complete." If setup work appears complete, the Agent SHALL run the gate and repair from inspect/advice rather than surfacing a status update.

#### Scenario: Setup persistent failure degrades silently

- **WHEN** setup gate has failed repeatedly without progress
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL record `silent_degradation` through an accepted trace/log surface
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT write `rb_status.json` state `blocked`
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT ask the user or report and stop
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT claim setup passed unless the setup gate passes

#### Scenario: Setup local completion runs gate instead of reporting

- **WHEN** setup validation appears locally complete
- **THEN** the Agent SHALL run the `setup-ready` gate
- **AND** the Agent SHALL NOT provide an intermediate progress summary
- **AND** any further action SHALL be driven by gate pass `check.next` or gate fail inspect/advice

### Requirement: Anti-cheating rules in phase bodies

每个 phase node body 的 Anti-Cheating Rules section SHALL 包含该 phase 特有禁令，并 reference `shared-anti-cheating-rules.md`。

#### Scenario: Each phase has phase-specific anti-cheating rules

- **WHEN** Agent 读取任一 pre-research phase 的 Anti-Cheating Rules section
- **THEN** section SHALL 至少列出 2 条 phase-specific 禁令
- **AND** 每条禁令 SHALL 指向正确替代动作
