## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Work-unit dry-submit SHALL preflight submit validation without side effects

The work-unit CLI SHALL provide a dry-submit preflight for claimed work units. Dry-submit SHALL read a candidate result and evaluate the same deterministic submit contract used by formal `operate-work-unit submit` wherever possible, including work-unit identity, queue binding, manifest/index consistency, result schema, runtime receipt, nonce, output files, source claims, cache trails, and kind output contract constraints.

Dry-submit SHALL be read-only. It SHALL NOT append `rb_output_declarations.jsonl`, complete queue demand, mutate `rb_queue.json`, change work-unit terminal/claimed status, write canonical result/receipt/cache files, record `last_submit_rejection`, create `_work_units/_transactions/` entries, write submit trace/log side effects, or emit success authority that gates may consume. Formal submit remains the only successful delegated completion transition.

Dry-submit output SHALL be structured enough for Agent repair. It SHALL report whether formal submit is expected to pass, the checked `work_id`, reason codes or violation codes, repair-targeted diagnostics, and any narrow normalizations formal submit would perform. Failed dry-submit SHALL still return structured preflight JSON rather than only throwing a stderr error. Normalization reporting SHALL NOT persist those normalizations during dry-submit.

Dry-submit SHALL mirror formal submit candidate path semantics. A candidate result path MAY be temporary or caller-provided when formal submit would allow it. The assigned work-unit directory containment rule SHALL remain limited to nonce normalization eligibility and SHALL NOT become a new dry-submit-only path restriction.

Dry-submit SHALL avoid validation branches that write as part of canonicalization. When formal submit would canonicalize cache `page-content.md` into `page.md`, canonical receipt JSONL, or assigned result JSON, dry-submit SHALL report the planned normalization without writing those files. Dry-submit SHALL validate the in-memory virtual canonical view that formal submit would validate, so read-only preflight does not reject a candidate solely because the canonical file has not been persisted yet.

Dry-submit SHALL accumulate independently evaluable violations so the Agent can repair multiple issues in one pass. If one failed check prevents dependent checks from running, dry-submit SHALL report that dependency rather than inventing validation results.

#### Scenario: valid dry-submit has no ledger side effect

- **WHEN** a claimed work unit has a candidate result that formal submit would accept
- **AND** the Agent runs `operate-work-unit dry-submit`
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL return `ok: true` or equivalent pass status
- **AND** `rb_output_declarations.jsonl`, `rb_queue.json`, work-unit status, assigned `result.json`, runtime receipt files, `_work_units/_transactions/`, trace/log files, and existing cache leaf files SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: dry-submit reports multiple repairable violations

- **WHEN** a candidate result has an invalid output role and a missing cache trail file
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL report both violations when both can be evaluated independently
- **AND** the diagnostic SHALL identify the output role problem and the cache trail repair target
- **AND** no ledger row or queue completion SHALL occur

#### Scenario: dry-submit reports normalizations without persisting them

- **WHEN** a candidate result uses a shape that formal submit would narrow-canonicalize
- **THEN** dry-submit MAY report the planned normalization
- **AND** it SHALL NOT write the canonicalized result, receipt, trace/log record, or cache surface
- **AND** formal submit SHALL still be required to persist any accepted canonical authority surface

#### Scenario: dry-submit does not materialize cache page aliases

- **WHEN** a cache trail has `page-content.md` that formal submit would canonicalize to `page.md`
- **AND** the Agent runs `operate-work-unit dry-submit`
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL report the planned cache normalization when relevant
- **AND** it SHALL validate the virtual `page.md` content that formal submit would materialize
- **AND** it SHALL NOT create or overwrite `page.md`
- **AND** a later formal submit SHALL still be required to persist the canonical cache leaf

#### Scenario: failed dry-submit does not mark submit rejection

- **WHEN** dry-submit finds a candidate result invalid
- **THEN** the work-unit attempt SHALL remain repairable without a submit rejection state change caused by dry-submit
- **AND** a later corrected dry-submit or formal submit MAY be attempted for the same claimed `work_id`

#### Scenario: dry-submit cannot satisfy gate coverage

- **WHEN** a work unit has only a successful dry-submit and no formal submit ledger row
- **THEN** wave gates SHALL NOT count that work unit as delegated coverage
- **AND** diagnostics MAY mention that formal submit is still required

#### Scenario: dry-submit accepts caller-provided candidate path under submit-equivalent rules

- **WHEN** a candidate result path is outside the assigned work-unit directory
- **AND** all identity fields already match the claimed work-unit record
- **THEN** dry-submit SHALL evaluate it under the same path semantics as formal submit
- **AND** it SHALL NOT require the candidate to be copied into the assigned work-unit directory before preflight
