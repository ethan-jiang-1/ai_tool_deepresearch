## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Work-unit tasks SHALL expose bundle-root absolute paths and write-before-return verification

Generated work-unit task Markdown and any Agent-facing claim/spawn output SHALL include the active bundle root normalized by the Engine as one canonical absolute `bundle_dir`, the exact work-unit identity fields, bundle-relative canonical refs, and absolute paths for files the sub-agent must read or write. The immutable Engine-owned `_beacon.json`, generated task, spawn/claim output, and generated work-unit CLI examples SHALL agree on that same absolute root. `bundle_dir` SHALL NOT be repo-relative, current-working-directory-relative, or only the bundle basename.

The task SHALL instruct the actor to use supplied absolute paths directly and to resolve each bundle-relative runtime ref under canonical `bundle_dir` exactly once. The actor SHALL NOT prefix a ref with the bundle basename before resolution, reinterpret an absolute path as bundle-relative, or treat a nested `<bundle>/<bundle>/...` path as a compatible runtime root. Every generated work-unit CLI command SHALL pass the canonical absolute root rather than depend on the actor's current working directory.

The beacon SHALL remain a read-only binding surface for the actor. The actor SHALL NOT overwrite, supplement, or manually repair it. Inspect, dry-submit, and formal submit SHALL reuse one beacon-binding evaluator that compares `bundle_dir` with the current Engine-resolved bundle root and compares the remaining beacon content with the index, manifest, and contract-derived expected binding. Relative `bundle_dir`, root mismatch, or other beacon drift SHALL fail closed before ledger, queue, assigned result, receipt, cache, trace, log, or transaction success writes.

Existing-authority reads SHALL validate their prerequisite before creating work-unit directories. A work-unit index load with `createIfMissing: false`, and inspect/dry-submit/submit or rejection handling built on that read, SHALL NOT create `_work_units`, `_work_units/_transactions`, a lock, trace, log, or other runtime surface when the resolved bundle root has no existing work-unit authority. Explicit create/claim paths MAY initialize work-unit directories only after the active bundle root itself has been validated.

The required verification SHALL cover declared `writes_to` outputs, `result.json`, `runtime-receipt.jsonl`, cache leaf files required by the work-unit cache policy, unchanged beacon binding, and absence of a same-name nested bundle root created by the actor. A sub-agent that cannot write or verify the files SHALL report work-unit failure rather than returning only research text.

For a current-version work unit, index, manifest and beacon SHALL carry top-level assignment_contract_version. Generated task, spawn prompt and checklist SHALL display that marker plus every resolved required output's exact absolute and bundle-relative path, canonical role, and closed direct_contract identity. Generated result schema SHALL constrain required output declarations and MAY describe the marker as read-only annotation, but SHALL NOT add assignment_contract_version or direct_contract as actor-fillable result fields.

For a current actor-bound production claim, the Engine SHALL derive one canonical role-guidance ref from the existing registered kind's closed `delegated_role_key`. It SHALL pass the existing claim-resolved kind and actor policy into the projection and require that policy's delegated role key to match, rather than reconstructing a second kind lookup from queue payload. It SHALL parse that canonical role's direct `requires[]` exactly one level, resolve each direct shared dependency as a contained regular shipped file, and project only dependencies whose own frontmatter declares `actor_delivery: required`; exactly one SHALL be the canonical page-fetch node with its closed `id`/scope identity. Role `requires[]` SHALL remain the dependency fact and shared-node frontmatter SHALL remain the delivery classification/identity fact rather than a role-to-shared allowlist in the projection helper. These refs SHALL be ephemeral task/spawn projections: they SHALL NOT be supplied by queue payload, Phase Agent or actor, persisted in index/manifest/beacon/result, discovered by directory scan or recursive loading, or added to the workflow manifest's always-loaded shared set. Generated task/spawn SHALL expose the same repo-relative refs plus resolved absolute read paths and require the actor to read them before search, fetch or output authoring.

For each non-empty `required_outputs[]` entry, generated task and spawn guidance SHALL display a bounded minimum authoring projection obtained from the same direct-output contract definition that dispatches fresh-byte evaluation. The projection SHALL name required structural or semantic content without returning raw validator code, regexes or an actor-fillable selector. Formal production claim SHALL preserve the existing actor-decision order: queue/assignment/actor-policy preview and actor decision occur first; a no-claim/invalid decision SHALL return through its existing repair without requiring delivery assets. Only an `allow_claim` decision SHALL resolve role/shared refs and every required descriptor during read-only delivery preflight before entering the write transaction, removing queue demand, allocating a work ID or publishing an envelope. Unknown role, missing/escaping guidance, invalid actor-delivery classification, unknown contract identity or missing projection SHALL therefore leave queue, index and envelope unchanged; kind/role mismatch remains the existing actor-decision root. The internal/test envelope constructor MAY preserve legacy envelopes with no actor binding and SHALL NOT fabricate a role to satisfy this current-claim projection. This preflight guarantee SHALL NOT be described as generic filesystem rollback for an I/O failure after mutation begins. All projections SHALL be generated from the validated assignment/manifest contract and SHALL not maintain a second artifact-field or heading inventory; shared evaluator remains verdict authority and existing role guidance remains the rich Agent-facing explanation.

The generated task SHALL require the actor to write and verify every assigned required output before returning work_done. The Phase Agent SHALL run the predictive dry-submit after the actor returns and before formal submit. It MAY repair only a mechanical parseable-candidate declaration: an absent/defaultable identity/schema field with one unambiguous value from the verified envelope, or an omitted/misdeclared required path/role when the exact assigned target passes its direct contract. It SHALL NOT overwrite a conflicting supplied identity or edit artifact, receipt, source or cache facts under that scope. A missing/unparseable candidate, missing target, YAML parse/top-level/schema failure, missing receipt/source/cache/finding/question/enum/semantic fact, or any repair requiring actor-owned fact changes SHALL be semantic_content. Before work_done, the selected actor owns semantic repair. After work_done, the Phase Agent SHALL run `operate-work-unit fail` with normalized reason `semantic_contract:<primary_root_code>` using the Engine-derived field, explicitly enqueue replacement demand under a fresh queue ID preserving the same canonical Topic and assignment_mode/receipt obligation, and obtain a replacement work ID for real actor execution. The reason SHALL NOT use `actor_spawn_unavailable:` or another accepted automatic-retry trigger. The Phase Agent SHALL NOT weaken a failed primary pair into supplementary mode or offer abandon as a competing normal semantic-replacement route.

Generated guidance SHALL distinguish a current supplementary attempt with no required_outputs from a primary paired assignment. It SHALL expose contract-authorized prior submitted paths without instructing the actor to overwrite them. The user SHALL not be asked to run ordinary search/fetch, dry-submit, fail/replacement, claim, or submit commands already permitted to the Agent.

Canonical role/shared guidance SHALL describe capabilities and rich authoring behavior but SHALL not expand the current assignment. Generated kind-specific guidance and role execution steps SHALL condition paired-output instructions on current `required_outputs[]`: a primary Wave1 pair SHALL write and verify both assigned targets; a supplementary empty-required-output attempt SHALL not recreate or redeclare prior evidence-summary/question-list files and SHALL write only current contract-authorized output/cache/source/result/receipt facts.

#### Scenario: Claimed task contains one canonical absolute runtime root
- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit claim` creates a work unit for active bundle `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **THEN** the generated beacon, task, spawn/claim output, and CLI examples SHALL use `bundle_dir: /repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **AND** the task SHALL include absolute paths for `_beacon.json`, `result.json`, `runtime-receipt.jsonl`, declared output files, and required cache leaf directories
- **AND** bundle-relative paths SHALL remain clearly labeled as refs relative to `bundle_dir`

#### Scenario: Bundle-relative refs are resolved exactly once
- **WHEN** a task declares canonical ref `_work_units/wave0/wu-w0-b001-src-i0001/result.json`
- **THEN** the actor-facing absolute path SHALL be `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation/_work_units/wave0/wu-w0-b001-src-i0001/result.json`
- **AND** no guidance or Engine normalization SHALL produce `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation/...`

#### Scenario: Beacon root drift blocks submit
- **WHEN** an actor overwrites the assigned beacon so `bundle_dir` is relative or differs from the current Engine-resolved active bundle root
- **THEN** inspect, dry-submit, and formal submit SHALL report beacon binding failure from the shared evaluator
- **AND** no ledger row, queue completion, assigned result normalization, transaction success, or provenance SHALL be written
- **AND** guidance SHALL NOT tell the actor to hand-write a replacement beacon

#### Scenario: Wrong nested bundle invocation has no filesystem side effect
- **WHEN** an Agent is already inside `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation` and invokes an existing-authority work-unit command with relative bundle argument `dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **AND** that argument resolves to nonexistent `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **THEN** the command SHALL fail on the missing existing bundle/work-unit authority
- **AND** it SHALL NOT create the nested bundle directory, `_work_units`, `_work_units/_transactions`, a lock, trace, log, or rejection state
- **AND** the nearest action SHALL be to rerun with the canonical absolute `bundle_dir` from the generated task/beacon

#### Scenario: Sub-agent must verify writes before returning
- **WHEN** a sub-agent completes a work-unit task
- **THEN** the task contract SHALL require it to verify every declared output file exists under the exact active bundle root
- **AND** it SHALL require `result.json` and `runtime-receipt.jsonl` to contain the exact `work_id`, `queue_item_id`, `kind`, and `receipt_nonce`
- **AND** it SHALL require cache trail leaves to contain required files before the sub-agent returns success
- **AND** it SHALL verify that beacon binding is unchanged and no same-name nested bundle root was created

#### Scenario: Chat-only completion is not successful delegated completion
- **WHEN** a sub-agent returns research findings in conversation text but does not write the required result, receipt, output, and cache files
- **THEN** the work unit SHALL remain unsubmitted or submit SHALL reject it
- **AND** the Phase Agent SHALL treat the return as work-unit failure or repair input, not delegated completion

#### Scenario: Claimed task contains absolute runtime paths
- **WHEN** `operate-work-unit claim` creates a work unit for active bundle `/repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **THEN** the generated task SHALL include `bundle_dir: /repo/dpt_rb_aidlc-investigation`
- **AND** it SHALL include absolute paths for `_beacon.json`, `result.json`, `runtime-receipt.jsonl`, declared output files, and required cache leaf directories
- **AND** bundle-relative paths SHALL remain clearly labeled as refs relative to `bundle_dir`

#### Scenario: task projects exact required output bindings
- **WHEN** claim creates a current primary Wave1 work unit
- **THEN** generated task SHALL name the top-level assignment version plus exact evidence-summary and question-list paths, canonical roles and direct contract IDs, while result-schema guidance constrains the exact path-role declarations without an actor-fillable contract field
- **AND** no generated projection SHALL let the actor choose another contract ID

#### Scenario: canonical role and authoring contracts reach the actor
- **WHEN** claim creates a current primary Wave1 work unit for registered role `dpt-evidence-extractor`
- **THEN** generated task and spawn prompt SHALL expose the same canonical role-guidance ref and absolute read path derived by the Engine
- **AND** the paired required outputs SHALL display contract-owned `Key Findings`, `Topic Investigation Targets`, `Question Reconciliation`, `Emergent Question Protocol`, and `Exploration / Exploitation Decision` minimum semantics before actor work begins
- **AND** dry-submit SHALL still obtain its verdict only from the shared direct-output evaluator over fresh target bytes

#### Scenario: unknown role or authoring contract fails before publication
- **WHEN** an actor-authorized registered role resolves to an unknown role key, missing shipped role/dependency file, invalid actor-delivery classification, unknown direct contract or missing contract projection during formal claim generation
- **THEN** read-only claim preflight SHALL fail before queue removal, work-ID allocation, index mutation or envelope publication
- **AND** no persisted role/shared ref or generic transaction-rollback claim SHALL be introduced
- **AND** the nearest action SHALL be to repair the existing kind/role/direct-contract owner rather than ask the actor or user to choose a replacement

#### Scenario: no-claim actor decision does not require delivery assets
- **WHEN** the existing actor decision returns no-claim or invalid, including kind/role mismatch, before allocation
- **THEN** claim SHALL return its existing actor-policy repair without reading role/shared delivery files or direct actor descriptors
- **AND** missing delivery assets SHALL not replace the nearer actor decision root for an attempt that was never authorized

#### Scenario: legacy envelope construction does not invent an actor
- **WHEN** an internal compatibility/test path constructs an envelope without current `actor_execution` binding
- **THEN** it SHALL remain outside production role-delivery claims and SHALL not infer or fabricate a delegated role
- **AND** formal `operate-work-unit claim` SHALL remain the production path that emits current actor-bound role/direct-contract guidance

#### Scenario: accepted Phase Agent fallback receives the same authoring guidance
- **WHEN** the existing actor decision authorizes one `phase_agent_fallback` claim for a registered kind
- **THEN** its generated task/spawn surface SHALL receive the same Engine-derived canonical role/shared refs and required-output descriptors as delegated execution of that kind
- **AND** the fallback SHALL retain its existing single-work-unit, dry-submit, formal-submit and provenance boundaries without gaining role or contract selection authority

#### Scenario: supplementary task projects no paired rewrite
- **WHEN** a current supplementary Wave1 assignment has no required_outputs and one eligible prior submitted evidence_summary
- **THEN** generated guidance SHALL expose that prior path as source-ref lineage
- **AND** generated task, spawn and canonical role guidance SHALL not list the prior evidence-summary or question-list as current required writes or unconditional role outputs
- **AND** the actor SHALL cite the authorized prior path without overwriting or redeclaring it

#### Scenario: Phase Agent repairs mechanical candidate drift
- **WHEN** post-return dry-submit proves the exact assigned target passes its direct contract but reports only an omitted/wrong result declaration path or role
- **THEN** recommended_action SHALL be repair_same_candidate and the Phase Agent MAY repair result.json without changing artifact bytes, then rerun the same dry-submit
- **AND** it SHALL preserve the recorded actor provenance and avoid user pipeline work

#### Scenario: semantic failure requires replacement execution
- **WHEN** post-return dry-submit finds missing real source facts, Key Findings content, or required question semantics after the actor recorded work_done
- **THEN** the Phase Agent SHALL not write the missing research content under that actor's provenance
- **AND** recommended_action SHALL be fail_and_replace, followed by `operate-work-unit fail` reason `semantic_contract:<primary_root_code>` using the Engine-derived field, explicit same-obligation enqueue under a fresh `queue_item_id` absent from every durable queue location, and a replacement attempt with a new work ID for real actor execution

#### Scenario: task projection is not an acceptance voter
- **WHEN** generated Markdown or result-schema guidance drifts from the reconstructed manifest/beacon contract
- **THEN** claim parity tests or submit contract checks SHALL fail
- **AND** runtime acceptance SHALL not use the projection to outvote the Engine-resolved contract
