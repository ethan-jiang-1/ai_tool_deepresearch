## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Work-unit claim SHALL bind queue demand and lease

Claim SHALL bind one `queue_item_id` to one non-terminal work-unit attempt, move queue demand into `delegated_in_flight`, write effective lease fields, and store the queue item snapshot hash. Claim MAY allocate a contiguous queue-front batch with `--count N`, but Sub-agents SHALL NOT allocate IDs or mutate queue/index authority.

Successful claim stdout SHALL include a static Agent-facing top-level `continuation` object for the immediate post-claim decision point: `interaction: prohibited` and `next_action: inspect_and_poll_claimed_work`. The cue SHALL include `work_ids` equal to the already returned `claimed_work_ids`, SHALL NOT be nested inside queue/index authority objects, SHALL NOT infer readiness, SHALL NOT complete work, and SHALL NOT add persistent work-unit state. Empty or failed claims SHALL NOT emit a successful continuation cue.

#### Scenario: claim creates in-flight attempt

- **WHEN** an eligible delegated queue demand item is claimed
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL create the work-unit envelope
- **AND** the queue demand SHALL be present in `delegated_in_flight` with the allocated `work_id`

#### Scenario: claim output directs immediate polling

- **WHEN** claim succeeds for one or more work units
- **THEN** stdout SHALL identify the claimed work ids
- **AND** continuation SHALL direct the Phase Agent to inspect/poll them without waiting for user input or task notification

#### Scenario: empty claim does not emit successful continuation

- **WHEN** claim returns `claimed_count: 0`
- **THEN** stdout SHALL NOT include a continuation cue that says claimed work should be inspected or polled
- **AND** queue/index authority SHALL remain the source of truth for why no work was claimed
